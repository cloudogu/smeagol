If you want to write documentation for a repository you simply have to add a <em>.smeagol.yml</em> file to the root of the repository. Once that is done you can use the wiki. Whenever you save changes to a wiki Smeagol pushes them to the repository. This way the documentation is always up-to-date and where it belongs - close to the code!.",
