    <p>Welcome to Smeagol, the repository documentation wiki.</p>
    <p>Below you see a list of all Git repositories on your repository server that you have access to. If 
        you want to write documentation for a repository you simply have to add a <em>.smeagol.yml</em> file 
        to the root of the repository. Once that is done you can use the wiki. Whenever you save changes to 
        a wiki Smeagol pushes them to the repository. This way the documentation is always up-to-date and 
        where it belongs - close to the code!</p>
